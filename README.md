## 🎯 Project Title

**MAITRI: Advanced Multimodal Mental Health Monitoring AI Assistant for Space Station Crew **

MAITRI (Mental Health AI for Space Station Crew) is a comprehensive AI-powered system designed to monitor and support the psychological well-being of astronauts during extended space missions at Bhartiya Antariksh Station.

## 🌌 Background

As India prepares for its ambitious space program with the development of Bhartiya Antariksh Station, ensuring the mental health and psychological well-being of astronauts during long-duration space missions becomes paramount. Extended stays in space present unique challenges that traditional mental health monitoring systems cannot adequately address.

MAITRI was developed as part of Smart India Hackathon 2025 to address this critical gap, leveraging cutting-edge AI and machine learning technologies to provide real-time psychological support for space station crew.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Space station crew members face unprecedented psychological and physiological challenges:

- **Extended Isolation**: 6-12 month missions with limited communication with Earth
- **Microgravity Effects**: Physical discomfort and disorientation affecting mental state
- **High-Stakes Environment**: Mission-critical responsibilities with zero margin for error
- **Sleep Disruption**: Irregular sleep patterns due to orbital mechanics
- **Communication Delays**: 4-20 minute delays in communication with ground control
- **Crew Dynamics**: Small team interactions in confined spaces
- **Distance from Family**: Psychological impact of separation from loved ones

Traditional mental health monitoring is reactive and insufficient for the unique demands of space missions, creating an urgent need for proactive, AI-powered psychological support systems.

## 📖 Detailed Description

MAITRI is a comprehensive multimodal AI system that provides continuous psychological monitoring and support for space station crew. The system integrates:

- **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Using facial recognition, voice analysis, and text sentiment analysis
- **AI-Powered Companionship**: Intelligent conversational AI with therapeutic techniques (both online and offline modes)
- **Predictive Analytics**: ML models forecasting mental health trends
- **Automated Intervention**: Critical issue detection with ground control alerts
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Integration of multiple data sources for holistic assessment

The system is designed for space station environments with **hybrid online/offline capabilities**, low-bandwidth operation, and mission-critical reliability. It seamlessly switches between online cloud services (Gemini AI) and offline local models (Llama 3.1 via Ollama) based on connectivity and mission requirements.

## 🛠️ Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Multimodal Data Integration**: Combining facial, vocal, and textual data for accurate emotion detection
- **Space Environment Adaptation**: Optimizing for microgravity, radiation, and limited resources
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency analysis with minimal computational overhead
- **Offline Operation**: Full functionality without internet connectivity
- **Data Privacy**: Secure handling of sensitive psychological data

### Domain Challenges
- **Psychological Expertise**: Developing AI responses based on evidence-based therapeutic techniques
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Hindi and English support for diverse Indian astronaut teams
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance for all crew members
- **Mission Integration**: Seamless integration with existing space station systems
